      <h1>Polish Portsmouth</h1>
      <p>
        In the Winter of 1833/34, the Prussian ship <em>Marianne</em> was travelling westwards
        across the North Sea. On board were 212 Polish soldiers who had been expelled from their
        homeland and were en route from Gda&#324;sk to America. Weather conditions, however, quickly
        deteriorated and in the face of high winds and heavy seas the ship&rsquo;s Prussian Captain
        was forced to seek shelter, eventually docking in Portsmouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the plight of the <em>Marianne</em> reached the attention of local newspapers in
        February 1834, it had been in dock for five weeks and relations between the German crew and
        their Polish &lsquo;cargo&rsquo; were, to say the least, tense. By this time, the winds had
        decreased and the ship was ready to continue its journey. With the anchor on the point of
        being raised, however, the Poles had forcibly taken possession of the vessel. So violent and
        threatening was their behaviour, the Captain claimed, that fearing for his own life, he had
        been forced to apply to the Civil Authorities for protection.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup
        >
        This version of events was hotly disputed by the Poles who alleged that Prussian agents had
        deliberately removed food and water supplies from the <em>Marianne</em> in order to force
        the soldiers to agree to depart for America. Eventually, following pressure from the legal
        courts in Portsmouth, some sort of a deal was reached and on 14 February the Poles
        disembarked from their ship and were transferred to lodgings on land.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The situation in which they found themselves was an unpropitious one; they had no food, no
        money, no guaranteed shelter and no knowledge of England and its language. Indeed, the
        majority of them were unable even to read or write in Polish. Their legal status, meanwhile,
        was uncertain and various schemes for their removal and repatriation had been suggested. The
        soldiers&rsquo; welcome in Portsmouth, nonetheless, was a warm one. A report circulated in
        early March 1834 noted that &lsquo;they had been treated with much hospitality by the
        greater part of the inhabitants, who daily visit them to administer to their comforts, and
        alleviate their forlorn situation.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup>
        Further support was provided through a series of hastily arranged fundraising activities. On
        7 March, a &lsquo;very gratifying and highly respectable&rsquo; charitable musical evening
        was organised at the Rainbow Tavern in St. George&rsquo;s Square, featuring &lsquo;patriotic
        and spirited sketches and songs&rsquo; by a Mr Woolfe; these were received with enthusiastic
        applause.<sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup> Two of the Polish soldiers
        attended the event and performed &lsquo;some native Polish songs.&rsquo;<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup
        >
        Later, speaking through a translator, the soldiers addressed the assembled audience to
        express their thanks for the support they had received.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup
        >
        The Forensic Society, meanwhile, a popular group which put on mock legal trials, organised a
        special fundraiser for the Poles which attracted &lsquo;nearly 500 people.&rsquo;<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup
        >
        Their efforts were helped by the gas company (which lit the room), the printer of the
        tickets, the doorman and the trumpeter who all provided their services free of charge.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup
        >
        A Polish concert organised at the Assembly Room attracted an even larger audience and raised
        over &pound;60 &ndash; the equivalent today of in excess of &pound;4,000.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup
        >
        Further events were put on by the Choral Society and the city&rsquo;s theatres.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup
        >
        The great and the good from across the city, meanwhile, queued up to make donations. The MP
        J.B Carter subscribed &pound;5 and 5 shillings<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup
        >, the Reverend R.B Sibthorpe gave &pound;5<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup
        >&nbsp;and Lady M.E. Lindsey &pound;3.<sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup>
        An anonymous donation of &pound;25 was received from an individual described &lsquo;as a
        friend to Poland.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup> Many others
        followed suit. Particularly noteworthy were the efforts of the city&rsquo;s children; by the
        beginning of March 1834, &pound;14 and 7 shillings (around &pound;1,000 today) had been
        raised through the combined work of four schools.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup
        >
        Eventually, this piecemeal, local support was supplemented and replaced by more official
        forms of relief. In June 1834 Parliament agreed to provide &pound;10,000 to assist Polish
        refugees across the country, and the following month the Portsmouth Poles were moved into
        semi-permanent accommodation at the former Old Garrison Hospital in Portsea. The
        enthusiastic support Portsmouth provided for its Polish visitors, however, did not go
        unnoticed. At &lsquo;A Meeting for the Relief of the Polish Refugees&rsquo; in London, the
        politician, Lord Dudley Stuart, to loud cheers from the assembled audience, praised the good
        work of the people of Portsmouth and the surrounding area.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup
        >
        The MP Cutlar Fergusson speaking at the same event concluded that &lsquo;the Conduct of the
        Inhabitants of Portsmouth could not be spoke of too highly.&rsquo;<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup

        Such activities raise a number of questions about Anglo-Polish relations, foremost among
        them: why were the residents of a provincial English city willing to provide such
        enthusiastic support for refugees from the other side of Europe? For much of the eighteenth
        century, the British public had shown little interest in Poland. And when the country was
        discussed, the focus was generally on the nation&rsquo;s, to British eyes, highly eccentric
        political constitution, particularly its elective monarchy and its <em>liberum veto</em>,
        the infamous mechanism through which any member of the <em>Sejm</em>&nbsp;(Parliament) could
        veto an act of legislation. Such accounts were invariably critical in tone and premised on a
        comparison between British advancement and Polish backwardness. The abuses Poland was to
        suffer at the hands of its neighbours, however, did much to alter perceptions. 1772, 1793
        and 1795 saw a series of progressively more extensive partitions, whereby Prussia, Austria
        and Russia worked in concert to annexe Polish territories. Under the terms of the final
        partition, Poland lost all its remaining territories and, as such, ceased to exist as a
        political entity. The elimination of a twelve-hundred-year-old state from the map of Europe
        received extensive coverage in the British press, as did the actions of the Poles who
        resisted the partitioning powers. Tadeusz Ko&#347;ciuszko, the leader of the heroic,
        although ultimately unsuccessful, armed uprising of 1793/4, quickly became a household name
        in Britain. Poets, among them Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats and Lord Byron, celebrated
        his bravery in verse, while Ko&#347;ciuszko&rsquo;s visit to England inspired both a
        portrait from the celebrated artist Benjamin West and a hugely popular novel,
        <em>Thaddeus of Warsaw</em>, by the Scottish writer Jane Porter.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup
        >
        The November Uprising of 1830 and the war with Russia that followed prompted an even more
        wide-ranging response; the vast majority of which was sympathetic to Poland and critical of
        the actions of the Russian Tsar, Nicholas I. The main incidents of the war were described in
        detail in both the local and national press, and a series of short introductions to Polish
        history were published for those who desired further information. Two journals, albeit both
        short-lived, were launched specifically concerned with Polish affairs &ndash;
        <em>Polonia</em> and <em>The Hull Polish Record</em> &ndash; and translations of the works
        of Poland&rsquo;s national poet, Adam Mickiewicz, were published in Britain for the first
        time in 1830.<sup><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup> A series of public events
        followed in which praise was lavished on the &lsquo;brave Poles&rsquo; and their noble
        cause. During a well-attended meeting in Blackfriars in January 1831, they were described as
        &lsquo;the vanguard of the heroes of liberty.&rsquo;<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup
        >
        At a public dinner at the Crown and Anchor pub in March of the same year, those present
        drank to &lsquo;the Independence of Poland, violated by fraud, may it be restored by valour,
        and cemented by liberty.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup> Taken
        collectively, such representations produced a sea-change in British attitudes. Indeed,
        speaking in 1848, Dudley Stuart concluded that whereas in the 1820s little was known about
        Poland, the events of the early 1830s had ensured that &lsquo;Polish affairs [were]
        comparatively familiar to the minds of all men in this country, and had excited so much the
        sympathy of all mankind.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup> This
        sympathy, it is true, was never to produce any direct British action aimed at
        re-establishing a Polish state. However, when a group of Poles washed up in Portsmouth in
        the Winter of 1834, the people of the city had firm preconceptions about them and their
        cause. These soldiers had fought against the Russians in the uprising of 1830/1 and, after
        fleeing on to Prussian soil, had been held in a Prussian prison for two years. As a
        consequence, they were not simply anonymous refugees from a far-away land. Rather, it was
        agreed, they were victims of the tyranny of Russia, Prussia and Austria, and upholders of
        the values of courage and liberty with which Britain sought to associate itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the years that followed, the Poles continued to inspire both interest and sympathy from
        the residents of Portsmouth. The 1835 funeral of one of the refugees, named in the press as
        &lsquo;Jozef Marrejouski&rsquo;, was attended by &lsquo;all his comrades&rsquo; and many
        gentleman of the town; music for the procession was provided by the Royal Marine band. A
        report in the
        <em>Hampshire Advertiser </em>concluded that the service had made a &lsquo;deep impression
        on the numerous spectators.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup> In
        December of the same year, &lsquo;several respectable families and inhabitants&rsquo; from
        Portsmouth attended a celebration at the Polish Barracks of the anniversary of the 1830
        Uprising. There was music, singing and dancing, and the same Mr Woolfe, who had contributed
        patriotic songs for the fundraiser in 1834, wrote a new ditty entitled &lsquo;The Warriors
        of Poland shall be free.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup> Despite
        such support, however, Anglo-Polish relations did not always run entirely smoothly.
        Ironically, some of the difficulties the &eacute;migr&eacute;s faced were a direct
        by-product of the high esteem in which Poland&rsquo;s cause was held. From the mid-1830s
        onwards, reports circulated in the press about the existence of &lsquo;fake&rsquo; Polish
        Patriots. Among the most successful of these individuals was a Captain Gordolphl &ndash;
        nicknamed &lsquo;the Magnetic Pole&rsquo; on account of his &lsquo;fascinating
        manners&rsquo; &ndash; who, until the police intervened, was employing forged certificates
        and passports to extract sympathy &ndash; and money &ndash; from the people of Glasgow.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup
        >
        The presence of such impostors clearly alarmed the Poles of Portsmouth, and the
        highest-ranking officer based in the city, Captain Stawiarski, wrote to the
        <em>Hampshire Telegraph </em>in May 1842 to remind readers that all Poles who were of
        &lsquo;good character and conduct&rsquo; received an allowance from the government.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup
        >
        Consequently, he noted, anyone who applied for &lsquo;relief&rsquo; on the streets was an
        impostor.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Other problems emerged as a result of indiscipline. In March 1835, a fight broke out among
        the Poles at the Garrison Hospital in which one of the soldiers was injured by a group of
        &lsquo;six or eight others.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup>
        Warrants were later issued against all parties and the case was brought before the Borough
        Court, only to break down because of a failure to find a competent translator. The soldiers
        were let off with a warning. Seventeen months later, one of the refugees, Joseph
        Roza&#324;ski, was arrested on charges of assault against a local woman, Ann Newberry.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup
        >
        The case was made even more serious by the fact that when the Constables went to the
        &lsquo;Polish Barracks&rsquo; to issue the arrest warrant, they were violently resisted by
        the other Poles, who seized Roza&#324;ski from them on multiple occasions. While not guilty
        verdicts were handed out to two individuals prosecuted for assaulting the police at the
        trial that followed, Roza&#324;ski was convicted and sentenced to six days in prison. This
        incident prompted heated discussion in the local press. A correspondent writing just after
        the initial incident noted that it was &lsquo;a disgrace to this country&rsquo; that while
        British workers were unable &lsquo;to gain a livelihood by the sweat of their brow&rsquo;
        &lsquo;a set of foreigners [&hellip;] can afford to get drunk nightly, and kick up rows in
        our street.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup> The
        <em>Hampshire Telegraph</em>, meanwhile, concluded that the soldiers were &lsquo;a disgrace
        to the neighbourhood and themselves.&rsquo;<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup
        >
        Attacks against the Poles became, meanwhile, even more frequent amidst the political unrest
        and social upheavals of the 1840s. Perhaps the most virulent was that developed by the
        Scottish politician, the Earl of Eglinton. Speaking to the House of Lords on 19 March 1849,
        he drew attention to the large medical bill that had been wracked up by Polish refugees in
        London and Portsmouth, implying, non-too-subtly, that this was a result of endemic
        syphilis.<sup><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup> Eglinton then went on to
        develop an angry general attack on the Polish diaspora, noting that in every incident of
        unrest across Europe this &lsquo;lawless and turbulent group&rsquo; were to be found
        &lsquo;revelling in scenes of anarchy and blood.&rsquo; Given that Britain&rsquo;s finances
        were in a dire state and its people starving, should the government, he asked rhetorically,
        continue to fund such a people? Ultimately, Eglinton&rsquo;s core accusation proved entirely
        unwarranted; an investigation concluded that there had only been one case of venereal
        disease among the Polish community in the previous year. And summarising the findings, the
        Marquis of Lansdowne concluded &ndash; to cries of &lsquo;hear, hear&rsquo; from the Lords
        &ndash; that &lsquo;he was satisfied of the general morality and conduct of the Polish
        exiles.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Claims that Poles were engaged in subversive political activity, however, proved harder to
        discredit, not least because they were, in many ways, accurate. This was particularly true
        in relation to the refugees based in Portsmouth. On their arrival, they had been contacted
        by various monarchist, liberal and socialist Polish &eacute;migr&eacute;s already active in
        England, who were anxious for new converts to their particular vision for a future,
        &lsquo;free&rsquo; Poland. Ultimately, it was the latter group who gained the ascendency;
        and in November 1835 the soldiers formed their own political organisation,
        <em>Lud Polski </em>(The Polish People), and issued a radical manifesto.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup
        >
        Central to this document was an angry critique of the role which the nobility had played in
        Polish history. &lsquo;Our fatherland&rsquo;, the manifesto proclaimed, &lsquo;that of the
        Polish people, was always separate from the fatherland of the nobility, and if there was
        contact between the two, it resembled that between a murderer and his victim. Throughout the
        world a sea of blood divides the gentry from the people.&rsquo;<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup
        >
        To rectify this situation, a violent revolution was required, which would sweep away the old
        order, and replace it with a system based on the collective ownership of the nation&rsquo;s
        resources. This initial document was signed by 133 of the Polish soldiers who styled
        themselves &lsquo;The Grudzi&#261;&#380; Commune&rsquo;, the name deriving from the town of
        Grudzi&#261;&#380; where they had been incarcerated prior to their arrival in England.<sup

        Other <em>Lud Polski</em> communes emerged first in Jersey, where the leading intellectual
        lights of the movement settled, and later in London. Over the following years, the
        Portsmouth group produced a wide range of polemics, entering into correspondence with both
        the other <em>Lud Polski </em>communes, and radical organisations and political leaders
        across Europe. At the same time, while initially reluctant to engage in English political
        debate, in the 1840s they took on a more public role in their adopted homeland. This
        culminated in a letter, published on 20 November 1841, to the Chartist newspaper
        <em>The Northern Star</em>.<sup><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup> In this
        address, the Poles criticised the treaty Britain had entered into with Russia, Prussia and
        Austria the previous year, and invited the people of England to join them at Portsea to
        commemorate the anniversary of the November Uprising. This Uprising, they claimed, was not
        just a Polish issue. Rather, it was an &lsquo;event which by the dispersion of the free
        people [i.e. the Poles who took part in the revolution] among all the oppressed people of
        the world, was [&hellip;], in the hands of providence, the means of uniting their mutual
        interests into one common and indissoluble bond: an event which, perhaps, was but the
        precursor of the general freedom of mankind.&rsquo; The <em>Lud Polski</em> organisation was
        eventually wound up in 1846, having achieved little to foment either Polish liberation, or a
        wider social revolution. Its vision of a class struggle between peasants and landed gentry,
        its ideas for the division of property and, more broadly, its advocacy of a form of
        socialism specifically concerned with the injustices of serfdom were, however, to prove
        significant. Indeed, for the historian Peter Brock, it was in the activity of the
        <em>Lud Polski</em> movement that &lsquo;the history of revolutionary populism in Eastern
        Europe begins.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup>

        Such achievements give the activities of Portsmouth&rsquo;s Polish community an important
        place in the development of socialist politics. However, at a day-to-day level, the evidence
        suggests that the Poles found life in Portsmouth a challenge. Many were resident in the city
        for a relatively brief period of time. By 1849 only 73 (of the original 212) Poles were
        living in the area, and by 1860 it was just 35.<sup

        A number of these individuals moved to other English cities, some sought a new life in
        America, others, it can be assumed, managed to return to Polish territories. Of those who
        remained, the majority lived out the rest of their lives in relative poverty as pensioners
        of the British government, first in the Military Hospital and later in a series of shared
        houses in the Portsea and Landport districts. These individuals, it should be remembered,
        many of whom were in their 40s on arrival in Portsmouth, had already endured much suffering.
        They had been agricultural serfs in their youth, seen violent military action in the
        November Uprising and, later, endured captivity in a Prussian prison. They had also
        completed a doubtless terrifying journey across the North Sea in high winds and heavy seas.
        It was, perhaps, unsurprising that after such experiences they turned, in a sense, inwards
        and sought solace in drink and the company of their fellow countrymen.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup
        >
        Other individuals did, however, come to engage more directly with the local area and its
        residents. Tomasz Lepik, for example, formerly a sapper in the Polish army, gained a living
        in Portsmouth as a tailor and, in 1839, married the daughter of a local upholsterer, Sarah
        Ross. They had their first daughter in 1841 and went on to have nine further children. By
        1861, Thomas, Sarah and their three eldest daughters were all working in the cloth trade.
        Micha&#322; Kisielewski, meanwhile, appears to have married into the same extended family,
        wedding a Mary Ann Ross in 1838, also the daughter of an upholsterer. Micha&#322; went on to
        become a tailor, while his eldest son, Alfred, worked as an upholsterer, and a younger son,
        William, served in the Royal Navy. Michel himself died in Portsmouth in 1882 at the age of
        74.<sup><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup>

        Polish names, albeit often horribly misspelt, continue to appear in the census and in the
        birth, marriage and death registers for Portsmouth throughout the nineteenth century. Within
        more public records, however, such as newspapers and periodicals, Poles feature increasingly
        infrequently. In part this was a product of the dwindling size of the group; by the 1850s
        and 1860s many of the original group of soldiers were reaching the end of their natural life
        spans. Equally importantly, however, Portsmouth had become accustomed to its Polish
        residents. While the refugees&rsquo; political beliefs remained radical, they were no longer
        the exotic, glamorous revolutionaries they had been thirty or so years previously, but
        rather an established presence in the city.

        In the 1960s, a committee was established to construct a monument to commemorate the
        achievements of Portsmouth&rsquo;s first Polish community. However, while building work
        began in 1965, funding soon ran out and the project was suspended with the monument
        unfinished. It was not until the twenty-first century that, under the direction of the
        Polish war hero Colonel Otton Hulacki, a soldier in General Anders&rsquo; 2<sup>nd</sup>
        Polish Corps and a participant in the Battle of Monte Cassino of 1944, the committee was
        revived and work recommenced. Thanks to the efforts of Major Hulacki, the Monument to the
        November Insurgents was completed in 2004 and unveiled in a ceremony at Kingston Cemetery,
        Portsmouth on 27 June of that year.

        1842, for example, was signed by over three million people. They were unable, however, to
        gain enough support in Parliament, and their proposals were rejected.

        sixteen years after their arrival in England none of the rank-and-file could read or write
        in English, and only a few had been able to pick up a little spoken English. See
